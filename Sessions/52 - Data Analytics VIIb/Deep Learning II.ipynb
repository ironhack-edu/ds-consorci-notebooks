The question is then: how to find the optimal parameters, ${\\mathbf w} = (W^i,{\\mathbf b})$, to approximate a function that is implicitly defined by a set of samples $\\{({\\mathbf x}_1, {\\mathbf y}_1), \\dots,  ({\\mathbf x}_n, {\\mathbf y}_n)\\}$?\n",

If there was an analytic solution to the problem, this should be the adopted one, but this is not the case for most of the cases. The techniques that have been designed to tackle these problems are grouped under a field that is called optimization. The most important technique for solving optimization problems is *gradient descend*.\n",

    "Enter the convolution operator. Given a two-dimensional image, $I$, and a small matrix, $K$ of size $h \\times w$, (known as a convolution kernel), which we assume encodes a way of extracting an interesting image feature, we compute the convolved image, $I∗K$, by overlaying the kernel on top of the image in all possible ways, and recording the sum of elementwise products between the image and the kernel:\n",

    "The convolution operator forms the fundamental basis of the convolutional layer of a CNN. The layer is completely specified by a certain number of kernels, $K$, and it operates by computing the convolution of the output images of a previous layer with each of those kernels, afterwards adding the biases (one per each output image). Finally, an activation function, $\\sigma$, may be applied to all of the pixels of the output images. \n",

    "Typically, the input to a convolutional layer will have $d$ channels (e.g., red/green/blue in the input layer), in which case the kernels are extended to have this number of channels as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, since all we're doing here is addition and scaling of the input pixels, the kernels may be learned from a given training dataset via gradient descent, exactly as the weights of an MLP. In fact, an MLP is perfectly capable of replicating a convolutional layer, but it would require a lot more training time (and data) to learn to approximate that mode of operation.\n",

    "## 4. Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, after a convolutional layer there are two kinds of non linear functions that are usually applied: non-linear activation functions such as sigmoids or ReLU and **pooling**. Pooling layers are used with the purpose to progressively reduce the spatial size of the image to achieve scale invariance. The most common layer is the *maxpool* layer. Basically a maxpool of $2 \\times 2$ causes a filter of 2 by 2 to traverse over the entire input array and pick the largest element from the window to be included in the next representation map. Pooling can also be implemented by using other criteria, such as averaging instead of taking the max element. "

    "## 5. Recurrent Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical neural networks, including convolutional ones, suffer from two severe limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ They only accept a fixed-sized vector as input and produce a fixed-sized vector as output.\n",
    "+ They do not consider the sequential nature of some data (language, video frames, time series, etc.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent neural networks (RNN) overcome these limitations by allowing to operate over sequences of vectors (in the input, in the output, or both). RNNs are called recurrent because they perform the same task for every element of the sequence, with the output depending on the previous computations. The basic formulas of a simple RNN are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ s_t = f_1 (Ux_t + W s_{t-1}) $$\n",
    "$$ y_t = f_2 (V s_t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "These equations basically say that the current network state, commonly known as hidden state, $s_t$ is a function $f_1$ of the previous hidden state $s_{t-1}$ and the current input $x_t$. $U, V, W$ matrices are the parameters of the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given an input sequence, we apply RNN formulas in a recurrent way until we process all input elements. The RNN shares the parameters  $U,V,W$ across all recurrent steps. We can think of the hidden state  as a memory of the network that captures information about the previous steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The novelty of this type of network is that we we have encoded in the very architecture of the network a sequence modeling scheme that has been in used in the past to predict time series as well as to model language. In contrast to the precedent architectures we have introduced, now the hidden layers are indexed by both 'spatial' and 'temporal' index. \n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs of a recurrent network are always vectors, but we can process sequences of symbols/words by representing these symbols by numerical vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's suppose we want to classify a phrase or a series of words. Let $x^1, ...,x^{C}$ the word vectors corresponding to a corpus with $C$ symbols. Then, the relationship to compute the hidden layer output features at each time-step $t$ is $h_t = \\sigma(W s_{t-1} + U x_{t})$, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ $x_{t} \\in \\mathbf{R}^{d}$ is input word vector at time $t$. \n",
    "+ $U \\in \\mathbf{R}^{D_h \\times d}$ is the weights matrix of the input word vector, $x_t$.\n",
    "+ $W \\in \\mathbf{R}^{D_h \\times D_h}$ is the weights matrix of the output of the previous time-step, $t-1$.\n",
    "+ $s_{t-1}  \\in \\mathbf{R}^{D_h}$ is the output of the non-linear function at the previous time-step, $t-1$. \n",
    "+ $\\sigma ()$ is the non-linearity function (normally, ``tanh``).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this network is $\\hat{y}_t = softmax (V h_t)$, that represents the output probability distribution over the vocabulary at each time-step $t$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, $\\hat{y}_t$ is the next predicted word given the document context score so far (i.e. $h_{t-1}$) and the last observed word vector $x^{(t)}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function used in RNNs is often the cross entropy error:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\tL^{(t)}(W) = - \\sum_{j=1}^{|V|} y_{t,j} \\times log (\\hat{y}_{t,j})\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross entropy error over a corpus of size $C$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\tL = \\frac{1}{C} \\sum_{c=1}^{C} L^{(c)}(W) = - \\frac{1}{C} \\sum_{c=1}^{C} \\sum_{j=1}^{|V|} y_{c,j} \\times log (\\hat{y}_{c,j})\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "These simple RNN architectures have been shown to be too prone to forget information when sequences are long and they are also very unstable when trained. For this reason several alternative architectures have been proposed. These alternatives are based on the presence of *gated units*. Gates are a way to optionally let information through. They are composed out of a sigmoid neural net layer and a pointwise multiplication operation. The two most important alternative RNN are Long Short Term Memories (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) networks. "
