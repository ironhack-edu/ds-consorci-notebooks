    "# Introduction to Regular Expressions (Regex) in Data Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular Expressions, often abbreviated as Regex, are essential tools in data analytics for processing and manipulating textual data. Regex provides a method for searching and manipulating strings using a specialized syntax that defines patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Regex?\n",
    "\n",
    "Regex is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. It can be used for performing various text processing tasks such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pattern Matching**: Searching for specific patterns within text.\n",
    "- **Data Validation**: Ensuring that data is in a correct format.\n",
    "- **Data Extraction**: Extracting specific portions from text based on patterns.\n",
    "- **Text Substitution**: Replacing parts of text using pattern matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Historical Context of Regular Expressions in Data Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular Expressions (Regex) have a rich history dating back to the 1950s, with foundational concepts developed by the American mathematician Stephen Kleene. This section aims to provide a deeper historical insight into Regex and its evolution in the context of data analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Origin of Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stephen Kleene's Contribution**: In 1956, Stephen Kleene introduced the concept of Regular Expressions in his paper \"Representation of Events in Nerve Nets and Finite Automata\" in the book \"Automata Studies\", edited by Claude Shannon and John McCarthy. This formalized the description of regular languages.\n",
    "- **Unix and Regex**: The widespread use of Regex began with Unix text processing utilities like `ed`, an editor, and `grep` (global regular expression print), a filter. These tools made Regex a fundamental part of text processing and pattern recognition in computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regex in Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regular Expression Processor**: This processor translates a regular expression into a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA), where several states can result from a given state and symbol. This automaton is then made deterministic (with only one possible state transition for a particular symbol) and is used to recognize substrings that match the regular expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Role of Regex in Data Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "In data analytics, Regex becomes particularly powerful in scenarios like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and standardizing text data for analysis.\n",
    "- **Log File Analysis**: Parsing log files to extract relevant information.\n",
    "- **Natural Language Processing**: Identifying and manipulating linguistic patterns.\n",
    "- **Data Scraping**: Extracting information from unstructured data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regex Syntax and Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Regex operations are based on a unique syntax that includes a variety of special characters and constructs. Some common elements include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.`: Matches any character\n",
    "- `*`: Zero or more occurrences\n",
    "- `+`: One or more occurrences\n",
    "- `?`: Zero or one occurrence\n",
    "- `[ ]`: A set of characters\n",
    "- `{ }`: A specific number of occurrences\n",
    "- `( )`: Capture and group\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources and Further Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "For those new to Regex, or looking to deepen their understanding, the following resources can be invaluable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Regular Expressions Quick Start](https://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html)\n",
    "- [RegexOne - Learn Regular Expressions with simple, interactive exercises](https://regexone.com/)\n",
    "- [Python's `re` Module Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "By mastering Regex, data analysts can perform more sophisticated text analysis and data manipulation, enhancing their overall data analysis capabilities.\n",

    "### 1. Iterating Over Each String in the List\n",
    "for test_string in test_strings:\n",
    "`test_strings` is a list containing multiple strings. In this `for` loop, we iterate over each element of the list. During each iteration, `test_string` refers to the current string being processed.\n",

    "### 2. Printing the Current Test String\n",
    "print('The test string is \"' + test_string + '\"')\n",
    "This line simply outputs the current string being examined in the loop. It helps in tracking which string the regex is being applied to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Searching for a Pattern in the String\n",
    "match = re.search(r'[A-Z]', test_string)\n",
    "Here, `re.search()` is used to find the first location within `test_string` where the regex pattern `[A-Z]` matches. This pattern looks for any uppercase letter from A to Z. The function returns an `SRE_Match` object if a match is found, and `None` if no match is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Checking for a Match and Printing the Result\n",
    " `\n",
    "if match:\n",
    "    print('The first possible match is: ' + match.group())\n",

If it's `SRE_Match`, it means a match was found, and we print the matched substring using `match.group()`. `group()` is a method of `SRE_Match` objects that returns the part of the string where the match was found. If `match` is `None`, it implies no match was found, and we print a message stating so.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Understanding the Behavior of `re.search()`\n",
    "- Single Character Match: Since the pattern `[A-Z]` is designed to match a single uppercase character, `re.search()` returns only the first matching character.\n",
    "- First Match Only: `re.search()` stops searching after finding the first match. It does not continue to look for further matches in the string.\n",

    "When working with regular expressions in Python, you have the option to compile your regex patterns into pattern objects. This can improve performance, especially if you're going to use the same pattern multiple times. Precompilation turns your regex pattern into an `SRE_Pattern` object, which can then be used to perform match, search, and other operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Precompile Regex?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance**: Compiling a pattern once and using it multiple times is more efficient than interpreting the same pattern repeatedly.\n",
    "- **Organization**: If you have multiple patterns, compiling them into objects helps keep your code organized.\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Once compiled, the same pattern object can be used in multiple match/search operations without recompilation.\n",
    "- **Legibility**: It allows you to assign descriptive names to your patterns, making your code more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Precompile Regex Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to precompile regex patterns in Python:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "# Precompile the pattern to match any uppercase letters\n",
    "pattern_uppercase = re.compile(r'[A-Z]')\n",

    "if match:\n",
    "    print('Uppercase letter found:', match.group())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, `re.compile` is used to compile the regex pattern `[A-Z]` which matches any uppercase letter. The resulting `pattern_uppercase` object can be used to search through strings without having to recompile the pattern each time, leading to more efficient execution, particularly when dealing with large amounts of text or many searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can even store multiple compiled patterns in a list and iterate over them, as shown in the following example:"

    "### Regular Expressions Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. Here's a detailed explanation of some commonly used terms and symbols in regular expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[ ] (Character Set)**: Square brackets denote a character set, where one element inside must match. For example, `[abc]` would match any of the characters 'a,' 'b,' or 'c.' You can also specify ranges like `[0-9]` to match any digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **| (Pipe or Alternation)**: The pipe symbol represents an \"or\" element. For instance, `a|b` would match either 'a' or 'b.'\n",
    "\n",
    "- **{ } (Interval Quantifier)**: Curly braces are used to specify an interval or the number of times a pattern should repeat. For example, `a{2,4}` would match 'aa,' 'aaa,' or 'aaaa,' where the number of 'a's falls between 2 and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\ (Backslash)**: The backslash is an escape character that identifies the next character as a literal character and not a special regular expression symbol. For example, `\\.` would match a period (.) rather than any character.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **. (Dot)**: In the default mode, the dot matches any character except a newline. For instance, `a.b` would match 'axb,' 'a#b,' or 'a$b,' where 'x,' '#,' and '$' can be any character except a newline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **^ (Caret)**: The caret symbol matches the start of the string. In MULTILINE mode, it also matches immediately after each newline. For example, `^abc` would match 'abc' at the beginning of a line.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$ (Dollar Sign)**: The dollar sign matches the end of the string or just before the newline at the end of the string. In MULTILINE mode, it also matches before a newline. For instance, `xyz$` would match 'xyz' at the end of a line.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\* (Asterisk)**: The asterisk causes the resulting regex to match 0 or more repetitions of the preceding pattern, as many repetitions as are possible. For example, `ab*` will match 'a' or 'ab' followed by any number of 'b's.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **+ (Plus)**: The plus sign causes the regex to match 1 or more repetitions of the preceding pattern. For instance, `ab+` will match 'a' followed by any non-zero number of 'b's but will not match just 'a.'\n",
    "\n",
    "- **? (Question Mark)**: The question mark causes the regex to match 0 or 1 repetitions of the preceding pattern. For example, `ab?` will match either 'a' or 'ab.'\n",

    "#### Additional Character Classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\d (Digit)**: Matches any decimal digit; this is equivalent to the character class [0-9].\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\D (Non-Digit)**: Matches any non-digit character; this is equivalent to the character class [^0-9].\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\s (Whitespace)**: Matches any whitespace character, including space, tab, newline, carriage return, form feed, and vertical tab. This is equivalent to the character class [ \\t\\n\\r\\f\\v].\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\S (Non-Whitespace)**: Matches any non-whitespace character. This is equivalent to the character class [^ \\t\\n\\r\\f\\v].\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\w (Word Character)**: Matches any alphanumeric character or underscore; this is equivalent to the character class [a-zA-Z0-9_].\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\W (Non-Word Character)**: Matches any character that is not alphanumeric or underscore; this is equivalent to the character class [^a-zA-Z0-9_].\n",

    "### Regular Expressions Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore some basic regular expression patterns and their explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example 1 - Matching Digits ( \\d )**:\n",
    "  - Pattern: `\\d+`\n",
    "  - Explanation: This pattern will match one or more digits (0-9) in a string. For instance, it will match '123' in 'abc123xyz'.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example 2 - Matching Email Addresses**:\n",
    "  - Pattern: `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}`\n",
    "  - Explanation: This pattern matches a basic email address. It looks for a sequence of characters, followed by '@,' then another sequence, a dot, and a domain with at least two letters. For example, it matches 'user@example.com.'\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example 3 - Matching Dates (dd/mm/yyyy)**:\n",
    "  - Pattern: `\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4}`\n",
    "  - Explanation: This pattern matches a date in the format 'dd/mm/yyyy,' where 'dd' represents the day, 'mm' represents the month, and 'yyyy' represents the year. For example, it matches '25/12/2022.'\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example 4 - Extracting URLs from Text**:\n",
    "  - Pattern: `https?://\\S+`\n",
    "  - Explanation: This pattern captures URLs that start with 'http://' or 'https://' and continue until the first whitespace character. For example, it matches 'https://www.example.com' within a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example 5 - Matching Words with Hyphens**:\n",
    "  - Pattern: `\\w+-\\w+`\n",
    "  - Explanation: This pattern matches words separated by hyphens. It looks for a sequence of alphanumeric characters, a hyphen, and another sequence of alphanumeric characters. For example, it matches 'cloud-based' in 'cloud-based solution.'\n",
    "\n",

    "### Capturing Groups in Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Capturing groups are a powerful feature in regular expressions that allow you to extract specific parts of a matched text. In Python, you can work with capturing groups using the `SRE_Match` objects and methods like `.groups()` and `.group()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Are Capturing Groups?\n",
    "\n",
    "A capturing group is a portion of a regex pattern enclosed in parentheses `( )`. It serves two main purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Grouping:** You can use parentheses to group parts of a pattern together. This is helpful for applying quantifiers like `*`, `+`, or `?` to multiple characters or subpatterns. For example, `(ab)+` will match one or more occurrences of 'ab' as a group.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extraction:** Capturing groups allow you to extract specific portions of the matched text. Each set of parentheses creates a separate capturing group, and you can access the matched content of these groups individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Capturing Groups in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, when you use regular expressions, the resulting match object (`SRE_Match`) provides methods for working with capturing groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`.groups()`**: This method returns a tuple containing all the captured groups. The 0th element of this tuple is the entire match of the whole regex.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`.group(n)`**: To access a specific capturing group, you pass its index `n` to the `.group()` method. The index is based on the order of opening parentheses in the regex pattern, starting from 1. Index 0 refers to the entire match.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate the concept with an example:"

    "\n",
    "- **`re.match(pattern, string)`**: This function checks if the regex pattern matches at the beginning of the input string. It returns a match object if a match is found at the start of the string or `None` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`re.search(pattern, string)`**: This function scans through a string, looking for any location where the regex pattern matches. It returns a match object for the first occurrence found or `None` if no match is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`re.findall(pattern, string)`**: This function finds all non-overlapping substrings where the regex pattern matches in the input string and returns them as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`re.finditer(pattern, string)`**: This function finds all non-overlapping substrings where the regex pattern matches in the input string and returns them as an iterator.\n",

    "The `check_sentences` function is designed to evaluate a list of sentences against a provided regular expression pattern and provide feedback on whether each sentence matches the pattern as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pattern`: This parameter represents the regular expression pattern to which each sentence will be compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `sentences`: This parameter is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a sentence and an expected result (True or False). The expected result indicates whether the sentence is expected to match the pattern or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of this function is to check each sentence in the `sentences` list against the provided regular expression pattern and provide feedback based on whether the match is as expected. It assists in validating whether sentences conform to a particular pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function iterates through each tuple in the `sentences` list, extracting the sentence and its associated expected result.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each sentence, it uses the `re.match()` function to determine if the provided regular expression pattern matches the entire sentence. The result of this match is stored in a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The function then evaluates whether the match is valid by comparing it to the expected result. If the match and expected result match, the sentence is considered valid; otherwise, it is not valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Based on the validity of the match, the function assigns a result message such as \"Pass\" or \"Not Pass\" for feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The function also determines whether the sentence is \"Valid\" or \"Not Valid\" based on the expected result and prepares a validity message.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, the function prints feedback for each sentence, indicating whether it passed or not, along with the sentence itself and whether it is considered valid or not valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "The function prints feedback messages for each sentence, providing insights into whether each sentence conforms to the specified regular expression pattern. This feedback assists in validating and verifying text data against a defined pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `check_sentences` function is a valuable tool for quality control and validation tasks involving text data, enabling the assessment of data integrity against predefined patterns or rules."
